# Android SSL Pinning Bypass

This repository contains scripts and tools to bypass SSL pinning in Android applications. SSL pinning is a security mechanism used by apps to prevent man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks by ensuring that the app communicates only with a server using a specific SSL certificate. However, during security testing or reverse engineering, it might be necessary to bypass SSL pinning to intercept and analyze network traffic.

## Introduction

SSL pinning is a technique used by mobile apps to enhance security by ensuring they only accept a specific certificate or public key. However, during penetration testing, it is often necessary to bypass SSL pinning to inspect the network traffic between the app and the server. This repository provides methods and tools to bypass SSL pinning in Android applications, allowing testers to carry out a more thorough security assessment.

## How SSL Pinning Works

In SSL pinning, an app is configured to only accept connections to a server that provides a certificate matching a pinned certificate or public key embedded within the app. This prevents the app from being tricked into connecting to a malicious server, even if the attacker can present a valid SSL certificate issued by a trusted certificate authority (CA).

## Bypass Techniques

### Frida

Frida is a dynamic instrumentation toolkit for developers, reverse-engineers, and security researchers. It allows you to inject JavaScript into native apps on Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, and QNX.

- **Advantages**: Does not require root access, versatile and can be used on-the-fly.
- **Script Example**: A Frida script can be used to bypass SSL pinning by hooking specific methods in the app that perform certificate validation.

### Xposed Framework

The Xposed Framework allows you to modify the behavior of the system and apps without touching any APKs. It is useful for bypassing SSL pinning by modifying the way an app verifies certificates.

- **Advantages**: Powerful and persistent, works well for rooted devices.
- **Module Example**: There are several Xposed modules like "JustTrustMe" that can disable SSL pinning in many apps.

### Custom Certificates

Another method to bypass SSL pinning is to install a custom certificate authority (CA) on the device and modify the app to accept this CA.

- **Advantages**: Simple and effective for certain types of apps, especially those that use standard HTTP libraries.
- **Disadvantages**: Requires root access, and may not work with apps that enforce strict pinning.

## Requirements

- Android device or emulator
- [Frida](https://frida.re)
- [Xposed Framework](https://repo.xposed.info/)
- Root access (for Xposed or custom certificate methods)
- adb (Android Debug Bridge)

## Setup and Usage

### Using Frida

1. **Install Frida**:
   - Install Frida on your computer and Android device. Follow the instructions on the [Frida website](https://frida.re/docs/installation/).

2. **Start Frida Server**:
   - Run the Frida server on your Android device:
     ```bash
     adb push frida-server /data/local/tmp/
     adb shell "chmod 755 /data/local/tmp/frida-server"
     adb shell "/data/local/tmp/frida-server &"
     ```

3. **Run the Frida Script**:
   - Use a Frida script to hook into the app and bypass SSL pinning:
     ```bash
     frida -U -f com.example.app -l ssl-pinning-bypass.js --no-pause
     ```

### Using Xposed

1. **Install Xposed Framework**:
   - Install the Xposed Framework on your rooted Android device.

2. **Install a SSL Pinning Bypass Module**:
   - Install a module like "JustTrustMe" from the Xposed Module Repository.

3. **Activate the Module**:
   - Activate the module in the Xposed Installer and reboot your device.

4. **Test the Application**:
   - Run the application on your Android device. The SSL pinning should now be bypassed.

## Troubleshooting

- **Frida Not Hooking**: Ensure Frida server is running correctly on your Android device and that your device is properly connected to your computer.
- **Xposed Module Not Working**: Verify that the module is compatible with the version of Android and Xposed you are using.
